# LG Runners Official Web site
The official site of [LG Runners](http://www.lgrunners.ga)

## Development
Gulp is our task runner and we use Bower for front-end package management.

The site is written in Jade and Stylus, which is compiled into HTML and CSS.  The Javascript is ES6, compiled into ES5 by Babel.  Very simple gulpfile.

To test the site, any web server works.  (Harp, SimpleHTTPServer, etc)
